/**
 * The privacy scanner (`verify-cassettes`) and the reference redaction policy (`record`) run their regexes over
 * whole cassettes, including raw event lines of 100 KB and more. A regex whose cost grows with the square of an
 * unbroken run — a local part with no `@`, a run of one repeated path root with no `/mnt/` — turns one such line
 * into seconds, and a long recording into a stall. This guard runs every scanner class, every rule of the shipped
 * `.cowork-redact.json`, `hostPathLeaked` and two end-to-end passes over 200k-character adversarial inputs.
 *
 * Each target runs in a CHILD process with a hard SIGKILL: a regression FAILS here instead of blocking the worker
 * (an in-process timing assertion cannot fire while the regex holds the thread). The binding check is the
 * per-input time measured inside the child: 1 s per input for one regex, 2 s for an end-to-end pass. The kill is
 * set at (inputs × budget) + 10 s, so a child whose every input is within budget can never be killed — a kill
 * means some input blew its budget and never returned. The linear versions take about 0.1 s at worst; the
 * quadratic ones they replaced took 3–22 s on these inputs.
 *
 * Engines differ, which is why this runs on each: `npm run ci` runs it on Node 22 (the engines floor) and in the
 * Node 24 unit shards, and it was measured on Node 22 and 25. Node 22's V8 runs an unbounded variable-length
 * look-behind (`file://[^/]*`) as a backward scan at every position — quadratic on a long run with no `/` —
 * where later engines skip it, so a regex can be linear on one engine and quadratic on another.
 * Targets are derived from the shipped code and policy, so a new class or rule is covered without an edit here.
 * Deliberately not a target: `scanHostInventory`'s inline `^mcp__…__` tool-prefix regex — anchored, it only ever
 * sees one `tools[]` name, and measures under 1 ms at 200k on its worst shape.
