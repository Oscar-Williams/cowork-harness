//
// This is a TRIPWIRE, not a semantic gate: it checks a COUNT (are there still ~as many gotcha
// items as before) and the PRESENCE of a few load-bearing section markers, matched as substrings
// so a reorder that renumbers a heading ("## 6. Assertions..." -> "## 5. Assertions...") still
// passes. It cannot tell whether a gotcha's *content* is still accurate, or whether a section was
// reworded into nonsense — only that a restructure/edit pass didn't silently delete the section or
// drop items wholesale. A real content review still needs a human (or a semantic diff) on top of
// this.
