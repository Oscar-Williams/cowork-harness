// Completeness check for the split of the companion skill's SKILL.md into a short entrypoint plus
// references/. The lists below are FROZEN from SKILL.md as it stood before the split (commit ec7ca3f):
// every section heading, and the first line of every numbered bold item (the 27 gotchas plus the two
// numbered workflows). Each must still appear, as a whole line, in SKILL.md or one of references/*.md.
// A section or gotcha dropped in the move goes red here even if every other guard stays green.
//
// Frozen on purpose: deriving the list from the current files would make the check pass by
// construction. When a later change legitimately rewords one of these lines, update the list in the
// same commit — that edit is the review signal.
